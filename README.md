# dragons-of-mugloar

 

The formal web app fetch game from Dragons of Mugloar API, and weather report from Royal Weather Service. The user can selectively distribute the dragon stats, (Warning the total stats is 20) and click post response. You response will be sent to the solve API and will also be displayed on your page. the result from the solve API server will be displayed on your page.
Both your response and result will be logged in dragonlog.txt located in the same folder with the program.
Note!!!
The page was created with PHP so, a local or remote server is needed to process the script.
If there is network error the page will not be loaded further, but instead error message will be return stating the cause of the problem and you will be prompted to try again.
